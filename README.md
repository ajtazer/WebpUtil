# WebpUtil
This is a shell script that converts all JPEG and PNG images within a specified directory (and its subdirectories) into the WebP format. WebP is a modern image format that provides superior compression compared to JPEG and PNG formats, resulting in smaller file sizes and faster loading times for web pages.
